# Adrenaline

Adrenaline is part of the SNAPSâ„¢ Program we are developing at
[CableLabs](http://cablelabs.com/) and [Altran](http://altran.com/)
to automate the installation of an open hardware platform with accelerators,
including GPU and FPGA cards. It leverages
[SNAPS-Boot](https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-boot),
[SNAPS-Kubernetes](https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-kubernetes) and
[Kubernetes device plug-ins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/)
to provide an easy-to-install platform where hardware accelerators can be
automatically configured and managed in a containerized environment and
utilized by operators in many applications.

# How to Deploy
## Set up build node
On a build node (physical or virtual) that has access to the target cluster,
install Ubuntu 18.04 on it.

## Install prerequisites on build node
Clone the git repository https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-kubernetes. If you
need access, please send an email to:
[snaps@cablelabs.com](mailto:snaps@cablelabs.com).

## Update configuration files for the environment
Copy <code><repo_dir>/adrenaline/conf/sample_hosts.yaml</code> to another file
(e.g., <code><home_dir>/conf/hosts.yaml</code>) and make changes according to
your environment, including server MAC addresses, networking interface names,
gateways, IP addresses, domain name, credentials, and proxy settings (if
applicable).

Copy <code><repo_dir>/adrenaline/conf/sample_k8s.yaml</code> to another file
(e.g., <code><home_dir>/conf/k8s.yaml</code>) and make changes according to
your environment, including private key file name, networking interface names,
artifact file location, and credentials for docker hub.

## Check post script file
Review
<code><repo_dir>/adrenaline/snaps_adrenaline/deployment/boot/post_script</code>
file content, and make changes as needed in order to run the desired post
script steps.

## Run the deployment command
Deploy the cluster. Since the command will PXE boot and install ubuntu 18.04,
execute post script, and deploy kubernetes on the cluster, it will last more
than one hour. We suggest you use <code>screen</code> session for the command
below so that it won't be accidentally interrupted.
```bash
sudo python <repo_dir>/adrenaline/launch.py -b <home_dir>/conf/hosts.yaml \
-k <home_dir>/conf/k8s.yaml -t deploy_all 2>&1 |tee ~/deploy.log
```
## Cleanup
In case you want to perform cleanup (e.g., after a failure), use the following
command:
```bash
sudo python <repo_dir>/adrenaline/launch.py -b <home_dir>/conf/hosts.yaml \
-k <home_dir>/conf/k8s.yaml -t clean_all 2>&1 |tee ~/cleanup.log
```
